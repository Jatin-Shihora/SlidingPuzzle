# SlidingPuzzle
Slide Puzzle game is a 2-dimensional game i.e the pieces can only be removed inside the grid and reconfigured by sliding them into an empty spot. The slide puzzle game developed here is a 4x4 grid game i.e 16 cells will be there from 1 to 15 (16 is not here since an blank cell is needed for sliding the neighboring cells)
